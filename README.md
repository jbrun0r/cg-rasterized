# Rasterize

Developed to consume the functions developed in this project in a more user-friendly way, this GUI allows you to insert coordinates for semi-straight plots and polygons. The GUI shows the rays in the continuous model, the rasterized rays and if the rays make up a convex polygon it shows the resulting image with the polygon filled in the graph subplot.

Default
The GUI is loaded with a default polygon, the GUI plots the rays defined in the continuous model, the edges of the rasterized polygon and then the polygon filled in the chosen color in the graph's subplots.
